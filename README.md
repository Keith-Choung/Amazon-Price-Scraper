# Amazon Price Checker
This program's goal is to take in an Amazon URL and check that item's price by storing user input and the scraped data in two separate csv files

Please feel free to contribute to this as it is my very first project :)

There is no installation process yet as it is not finished.

Steps to Use:
- scraper.py is the scraper that will scrape, compare and store the data if necessary
- organize.py has the accessory funcitons to be able to use in an interactive way like addURL, removeURL, and more.

Requirements:
- Python 3.4+
- Terminal

ToDo List:
- Allow interactive usage, either through terminal or GUI (Tkinter?)
- Implement email/text function through SMTP to notify user of updated prices
- Add more test CSV data
- Determine what input removeURL should take
